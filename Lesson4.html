        <h1><b><i>MY WEEKEND</i></b></h1>
        <p>
            <br>The third Saturday of <strong>February</strong> 
            <br>it was a very long and funny day for me
            <br>i woke up early in the morning having confidence and feeling energy of going to school as
            <br>i walked to the school gate to wait for the bus to come and pick us up i saw many learners standing there and i asked my self 
            <br>"<i>why are we many today?</i>" and i realised that the grade 10s are joining the project we are in that day.
            <br>At school it was boring because they have changed our Maths teacher and it will take to long for us to understand the new 
            <br>teacher we even wrote the Physical sciences test 
            <br>it was short and a little bit challenging but atleast i have passed the test.When we was about to 
            <br>go home we had to run to the bus before the sits was full.
